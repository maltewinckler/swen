# Contributing

SWEN is a personal project, but contributions are welcome — especially bug fixes, documentation improvements, and small self-contained features.

## How to Contribute

1. **Bug reports** → [Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/maltewinckler/swen/issues) with steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behaviour, and your deployment method (Docker / bare metal).
2. **Feature requests** → Open an issue for discussion first. Large features may not align with the project scope.
3. **Code contributions** → Fork, branch, implement, open a PR against `main`. See [Dev Setup](setup.md) and [Conventions](conventions.md).
4. **Documentation** → Any improvements to `/docs/` are always welcome — open a PR directly.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and assume good faith. This is a hobby project.

## Licensing

SWEN is licensed under the **MIT License**. By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution will be licensed under the same terms.

## What Is Likely to Be Merged

✅ Bug fixes with a failing test that proves the fix
✅ Documentation corrections and improvements
✅ Small UX improvements with clear motivation
✅ New FinTS bank compatibility fixes
✅ Performance improvements with benchmarks

❌ Large new features without prior discussion
❌ Dependencies that add significant supply chain risk
❌ Changes to the core DDD/hexagonal architecture without strong justification
❌ Frontend rewrites (the current frontend works; a review + incremental improvements are preferred)

## Getting Help

For questions about the codebase, open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/maltewinckler/swen/discussions) or a draft PR with your question.
